        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the flour in a mixing bowl, 
                form a small well and crumble the yeast into it.</li>
            <li>Mix with 3 tablespoons of warm water 2-3 times 
                and cover with a little flour from the edge.</li>
            <li>Cover and let the pre-dough rise for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the 15 minutes, add the remaining ingredients 
                to the bowl and knead with the  hook for 5 minutes on a 
                medium setting. You could also use your hands but it will take longer.</li>
            <li>Cover with a cloth and let rise for 1 hour. You can also let the dough rise in the fridge over night but 
                then only use 10g of yeast.</li>
            <li>After rising time, knead the dough well again 
                on a work surface and divide into 4 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Roll the pieces of dough into an approx. 60cm long strand and knot it into a bretzel.</li>
            <li>Place the bretzel on a baking sheet lined with baking paper and let rise covered for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220 Â° C top / bottom heat.</li>
            <li>Bring the water to a boil and add the baking soda, then remove from the stove. Mix with a wooden spoon until the baking soda has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Place the bretzel one after the other in the lye bath and leave to stand on both sides for 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>With the help of a ladle, remove the bretzel from the bath and place them back on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle immediately with salt or sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes until they have taken on the typical color of the bretzel.</li>
